# Mortgage Calculator 

This was made using ```npx create-react-app mortgage-calc --template typescript``` testing and working
<br>Demo: [here](https://mortgage-calculator-react-ts.herokuapp.com/)
<br>Next Step: implement a Modal component to display API call values.
<br>This is a single page responsive website made to take values and send them to an API to calculate monthly and annual payments.
<br> I made this using React with Tailwind CSS. Currently the form is handled using react-hook-form for state management and it's ease of use integrating into an existing form, as well as it's ability to perform as little re-renders as possible. The built in validation is also a nice touch, and will help with implementing conditional validation due to the API needing one or some required inputs.
